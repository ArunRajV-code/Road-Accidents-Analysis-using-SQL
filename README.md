# 🚧 Road Accident Analysis Using SQL

## 📄 Overview
This project explores road accident data to uncover critical insights into accident patterns, causes, and high-risk zones. By leveraging SQL for data exploration and aggregation, the analysis empowers authorities and stakeholders to make informed decisions for improving road safety and minimizing accident rates.

## 🎯 Objectives
- **Data Cleaning**: Ensure data quality by handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.  
- **Accident Trend Analysis**: Identify temporal, geographic, and demographic patterns in road accidents.  
- **Risk Factor Evaluation**: Determine major contributing factors such as weather, time of day, and vehicle type.  
- **Hotspot Detection**: Highlight accident-prone areas for targeted interventions.  
- **Policy Recommendations**: Offer actionable suggestions to enhance road safety and reduce incidents.  

## 🔍 Key Highlights
- **Data-Driven Safety Insights**: Discover trends over time, across regions, and among demographics.  
- **High-Risk Analysis**: Pinpoint peak hours, accident types, and vulnerable road user categories.  
- **Location Intelligence**: Identify regions with the highest accident density.  
- **Preventive Strategies**: Support data-backed planning for safety measures and awareness campaigns.  

## 📊 Data Features
The dataset includes the following key attributes:
- **Date & Time**: Temporal patterns and peak accident hours.  
- **Location**: Geographic mapping of high-incident zones.  
- **Vehicle Type**: Analysis of accident distribution by vehicle category.  
- **Cause of Accident**: Primary reasons contributing to road accidents.  
- **Severity**: Categorization of accidents based on impact and casualties.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **SQL**: For querying, data wrangling, aggregation, and analysis.  
- **Database Systems**: MySQL / PostgreSQL / SQLite used for managing datasets.  
- **Visualization Tools** *(optional extension)*: Power BI / Tableau for geospatial and temporal visualization.  

## 🚀 Impact
- **Public Safety Enhancement**: Informs strategies to reduce road accident rates.  
- **Resource Allocation**: Aids in efficient deployment of emergency services.  
- **Policy Development**: Supports formulation of traffic regulations and awareness campaigns.
